    <h3>Life Expectancy Analysis</h3>
    <p>This visualization presents a world map illustrating the changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2015. 
        Countries such as Canada, the United States, Australia, Chile, Uruguay, French Guiana, South Korea, Japan and many European 
        nations consistently rank among the highest in terms of life expectancy, with values surpassing 75 years 
        throughout the period. These countries tend to have higher GDPs, which often correlate with better healthcare
        systems, higher standards of living, and overall better health outcomes. In contrast, many African nations 
        consistently show the lowest life expectancy, which is strongly associated with their lower GDPs. The 
        majority of countries fall within the average life expectancy range of 45 to 55 years. The visualization highlights how life
        expectancy varies significantly around the world, showing a direct link between high life expectancy and higher GDPs. 
        This correlation demonstrates the importance of economic factors in shaping health outcomes.
