    <h1>DS4200 Final Project: Life Expectancy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
        The topic of this project is life expectancy and the various factors that influence it across
        different countries. The goal is to explore and visualize key metrics such as GDP, education,
        vaccination rates, and other socioeconomic indicators to better understand their impact on life
        expectancy. In addition, we would like to see the difference between countries with high and low
        life expectancy, and how these factors vary across different regions of the world.

    <h2>About the Dataset:</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paperxd/cleaned-life-expectancy-dataset/data">The dataset</a>
        used in this project was found on Kaggle, where all of the data has been sourced from the
        Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository of the World Health Organization (WHO), which tracks
        health metrics and related factors for countries worldwide. The economic data was obtained from the
        United Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dataset includes data for 193 countries and contains 22 columns and 2,938 rows,
        representing 20 predictive variables such as GDP, schooling, vaccination status, and more.
        Countries with many missing values were excluded to ensure data quality.
